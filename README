This is a fast arimaa move generator written in c.

From a starting arimaa state, represented as a bit board, this generator
produces a bit set representing all of the possible single step moves to
the next state.  The bit set of moves is calculated efficiently, and in
constant time, no matter if there are few or many moves.

Standing alone, this is an incomplete program.  It is intended to be used
as part of a larger program that uses artificial intelligence to decide
the best move.
